I mean, they were some of the greatest artists ever. Right, but I wonder how easy they would find it living and working in the modern world. Blind people can use a guide dog or a white cane to help them move around. Yes, but a white cane is hardly advanced technology. Recently, smartphone apps have been invented which dramatically improve the lives of blind people around the world.",
