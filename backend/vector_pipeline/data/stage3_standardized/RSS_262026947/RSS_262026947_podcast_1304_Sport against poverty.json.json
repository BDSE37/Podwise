Instead, we'll discuss how sport can change the lives of young people from some of the poorest, toughest backgrounds on earth. And of course, we'll be learning some vocabulary on the way. Many projects around the world use sport to change children's lives, improving mental health, challenging stereotypes and giving hope. Among them is the Ebony Club in Brixton, which uses sport to help young people in London's most disadvantaged communities.",
